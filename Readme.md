Redirects fix for `https://topepo.github.io` based on [this page](https://gist.github.com/domenic/1f286d415559b56d725bee51a62c24a7). 

Once the `tidymodels` organization was enabled, all of the previous `pkgdown` sites had broken links since [GitHub does not forward them](https://blog.github.com/2013-05-16-repository-redirects-are-here/): 

> There is one caveat with the new redirect support worth noting: GitHub Pages sites are not automatically redirected when their repositories are renamed at this time. Renaming a Pages repository will continue to break any existing links to content hosted on the github.io domain or custom domains.
